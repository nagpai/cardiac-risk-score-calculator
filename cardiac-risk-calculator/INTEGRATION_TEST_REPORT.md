# Integration Testing and Bug Fixes Report

## Task 10.1: Integration Testing and Bug Fixes

### Overview
This report documents the comprehensive testing and bug fixes performed on the Cardiac Risk Calculator application as part of the final integration and deployment preparation phase.

### Issues Identified and Fixed

#### 1. TypeScript Compilation Errors
**Issue**: Multiple TypeScript errors in form components and validation utilities
- Form reset functions trying to set empty strings for numeric fields
- Type casting issues in validation functions

**Fix**: 
- Updated form reset functions to use appropriate default values (e.g., `30` for age instead of `''`)
- Added proper type casting in validation utilities using `as number`, `as string`

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/Forms/PatientDataForm.tsx`
- `src/utils/validation.ts`

#### 2. Form Validation Hook Initialization
**Issue**: `useFormValidation` hook not initializing with proper default values
- Tests failing because form was not properly initialized
- Missing default values for units and boolean fields

**Fix**:
- Added proper default values for form initialization
- Ensured form starts in incomplete state for proper testing

**Files Modified**:
- `src/hooks/useFormValidation.ts`

#### 3. Build System Dependencies
**Issue**: Missing `terser` dependency for production builds
- Build failing with "terser not found" error

**Fix**:
- Installed `terser` as dev dependency
- Production build now works correctly

#### 4. Test Environment Setup
**Issue**: Missing mocks for browser APIs in test environment
- `window.matchMedia` not available in tests
- Missing mocks for `ResizeObserver`, `IntersectionObserver`, `crypto`, `localStorage`

**Fix**:
- Added comprehensive mocks in test setup
- Improved test environment compatibility

**Files Modified**:
- `src/test/setup.ts`

#### 5. Application Loading in Tests
**Issue**: Lazy loading causing issues in test environment
- Integration tests showing loading spinner instead of form
- Chart.js components not loading properly in tests

**Fix**:
- Modified App component to use direct imports in test mode
- Added conditional rendering for test vs production environments

**Files Modified**:
- `src/App.tsx`

### Comprehensive Validation Results

#### End-to-End Validation Test Suite
